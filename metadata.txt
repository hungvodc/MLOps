Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on input-output example pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. Each example is a pair consisting of an input object and a desired output value. A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario allows for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. Supervised learning problems are categorized into regression and classification problems. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object and a desired output value.
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. Clustering algorithms are used to classify objects or data into groups called clusters, such that objects within the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects belonging to different clusters. Unlike supervised classification, clustering analysis does not rely on predefined classes. Rather, similar groups of data are clustered together using statistical algorithms that find similarities among data instances. Unsupervised learning problems further include dimensionality reduction and association rule learning.
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training technique concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles, robotics, game playing, and numerous other application areas. In reinforcement learning, the agent learns from the environment through trial and error interactions. The environment provides reward or penalty for each action that the agent takes. The agent tries various strategies called policies to maximize the long term reward. The agent needs to balance exploration of uncharted territory with exploitation of current knowledge. Too much exploration may lead to too little exploitation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labeled input/output pairs, and in not telling the agent exactly what action to take, but instead relying on rewards or punishments to shape behavior.
Classification is the machine learning task of predicting the categorical class label of new instances based on past observations. A classification algorithm takes data with known labels as input and builds a model to predict the class of new unlabeled data. For example, an algorithm that classifies email messages as spam or not spam is a classification algorithm. Popular classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines and random forests.
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points together that have similar characteristics. The goal of clustering is to find groups such that data points in the same group are more similar to each other than points in different groups. Unlike classification, clustering does not rely on predefined classes. Popular clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture models and DBSCAN. Clustering requires defining a similarity measure between data points, like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity. Performance metrics include intra-cluster variance, Silhouette coefficient and Calinski-Harabasz index. Applications include market segmentation, social network analysis, recommendation systems and medical imaging analysis.
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. It helps reduce overfitting, improves model performance, and reduces training time. Methods like principal component analysis use orthogonal transformation to convert possibly correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. Linear discriminant analysis finds linear combinations of features that separate classes. Both convert data in higher dimensions to lower dimensions.
Overfitting refers to a model that models the training data too well, capturing the noise and details, that it negatively impacts its ability to generalize to new data. It occurs when a model fits the training data too closely. An overfit model has low bias but very high variance. It has memorized the noise and details in the training set to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new data. This leads to poor predictions on unseen data though it may have high performance on training data. Overfitting can be mitigated by techniques like regularization, early stopping, and dropout.
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes loss by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent. The slope of the surface dictates the direction of movement. It follows the direction of decreasing objective function gradient to find the local minimum. For machine learning, gradient descent tweaks model parameters like weights and biases of neural networks or coefficients of regression models to minimize loss. The learning rate determines the size of steps to reach a local minimum. Adaptations like momentum, Nesterov accelerated gradient keep the optimization stable.
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time. For each tree in the ensemble, a random sample is drawn from the training set when growing the tree. While splitting each node during the construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the best split among a random subset of the features. This process of randomizing helps reduce overfitting across a large number of trees and improves generalization ability. The output prediction is made by each tree in the forest, with the classification being the mode of the classes output by individual trees.
K-nearest neighbors or KNN algorithm is a simple supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It assumes that data points that are in close proximity likely have similar properties and class labels. KNN stores all training data and classifies new data points based on majority class of its k closest neighbors in the training set. A data point is assigned the class label that appears most frequently among its k nearest neighbors. The distance metric commonly used is Euclidean distance. The value of k is a positive integer and varies based on nature of input data. KNN makes no assumptions about underlying data and chooses neighbors based on distance functions.
Kernel methods refer to a class of algorithms that depends on the data only through dot products. The kernel represents a function that quantifies similarity between two data points. It transforms data into a higher dimensional space to make it separable. Kernel functions like radial basis function and polynomial kernels correspond to similarity measures used by algorithms like support vector machines for classification and regression. Kernel trick is used to avoid explicitly mapping data to higher dimensions, instead using the kernel function to compute dot product between mapped data points. This makes computation faster. Kernel methods allow generalization of linear algorithms to nonlinear settings.
Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, measures difference between two probability distributions for use in classification problems with probabilities as output. It uses a probabilistic interpretation to logistic regression and outputs a probability between 0 and 1 for binary classification. The loss function measures dissimilarity between true labels and predicted probabilities. It increases as predicted probability diverges from true label. Log loss penalizes false classifications more than correct ones and rewards high confidence predictions that are correct. It is useful for multi-class prediction as well by applying softmax to neural network output to represent class probabilities.
The bias-variance tradeoff refers to balancing the bias and variance of a model to optimize its performance. Bias represents error due to oversimplifying the model. High bias can cause underfitting. Variance represents sensitivity to changes in training data. High variance can cause overfitting. Ideally, we want low bias and low variance models. As model complexity increases, variance typically increases and bias decreases. Tuning model hyperparameters involves balancing bias and variance. Simple models have high bias, low variance. Complex models have low bias, high variance.
Regularization refers to adding a penalty term to the loss function to induce a model that fits training data well but does not overfit. The penalty term constraints model parameters that lead to complex models. Regularization helps improve generalization by preventing overfitting. Two common types of regularization are L1 and L2 regularization. L1 adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of magnitude of coefficients. L2 adds penalty equivalent to square of magnitude of coefficients. This shrinks coefficients and makes model simpler and less prone to overfitting.
Support vector machines or SVM are supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly separates the data points into classes. The hyperplane maximizes the margin between the two classes. The data points nearest the hyperplane are support vectors. Kernel functions like polynomial or RBF are used to transform data to higher dimensions to make it separable. SVM handles nonlinear relationships well. SVMs can be extended to multiple classes using one-vs-one or one-vs-rest approaches. Parameters like soft margin and regularization affect performance.
A confusion matrix visually summarizes the performance of a classification model. It is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. Each row represents instances of the actual class, while each column represents instances of the predicted class. It provides the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. Additional evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score can be derived from the confusion matrix. It provides insight into errors being made by a classifier and types of misclassifications.
K-fold cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited dataset. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that the given data is to be split into. The dataset is divided into k subsets of equal size. Each time, one of the k subsets is used as the test set and the other k-1 subsets are put together to form a training set. The model is fit on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The procedure is repeated k times so that each subset serves as the test set once. The k results are averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of k-fold cross-validation is that all observations are used for both training and testing.
Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features in the data that contribute most to the prediction variable or output in which we are interested. It helps reduce overfitting, improves model performance, and reduces training time. Methods like filter methods select subsets of variables independent of the model. Wrapper methods utilize the model performance to select features. Embedded methods learn which features contribute most to the accuracy of the model while training. The key goals are to improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting, reduce training time, and provide faster and more cost-effective models. Common approaches include univariate selection, recursive feature elimination, and regularization.
Boosting refers to an ensemble technique that converts weak learners into strong learners for classification or regression problems. It focuses on training data that was incorrectly predicted by previous models and gives higher priority to examples that were misclassified. AdaBoost is a commonly used boosting technique. It trains subsequent weak models on modified versions of the training data that focus more on examples misclassified by previous models. The final model prediction is calculated as a weighted sum of the predictions from all the trained weak models. Boosting helps reduce bias and variance to improve model performance. The general idea is to train models sequentially, with each new model attempting to correct errors from the previous model.
Precision is a performance metric for classification models. It refers to the number of positive class predictions made by the model that actually belong to the positive class divided by the total number of positive class predictions made. It provides insights into how many selected items are relevant. High precision indicates lower number of false positives. High recall and high precision indicates a good classifier. Precision is also referred to as positive predictive value.
Naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem that assumes strong independence between features. It is termed naive because it makes the simplifying assumption that the presence of a feature is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. This conditional independence assumption allows the model to estimate the probability of a class given an instance by the probabilities of the attributes present in the instance. Even when the assumption of independence is violated, the model performs surprisingly well in most cases. Naive Bayes models are easy to build and useful for very high-dimensional datasets. They often outperform even highly sophisticated models.
Hyperparameter tuning refers to choosing optimal hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms to improve model performance. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set prior to model training, unlike model parameters that are learned during training. For example, for kNN model, k is a hyperparameter. Grid search evaluates performance for all hyperparameter combinations in a specified grid. Random search samples combinations randomly from a hyperparameter space. Bayesian methods use probabilistic models for hyperparameter optimization. The optimal combination is found by iterative optimization guided by a validation set performance metric like accuracy. Automated tuning removes manual effort to find the best hyperparameters.
Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both regression and classification. They create a model that predicts the value or class of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. It is called a tree because it starts with a root node and branches into possible decisions that lead to terminal nodes or leaf nodes that represent the outcome. Decision trees learn by a process of recursive partitioning of the data. Their advantages include interpretability, ability to handle nonlinear relationships and few tuning parameters.
Logistic regression is an algorithm for classification problems when the output variable is categorical, for example binary classification problems with two possible classes. Logistic regression uses a logistic function with a logit link to model the probability of the binary outcomes. The probabilities are mapped to two classes by applying a threshold, usually 0.5. The model coefficients are learned using maximum likelihood estimation. Logistic loss function measures probability error and is minimized to train the coefficients. Regularization like L1 and L2 helps prevent overfitting. Logistic regression assumes linear relationship between log odds of outcomes and predictor variables.
ROC curve stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. It is a plot of the true positive rate vs the false positive rate for a classification model as the discrimination threshold varies. It visualizes the tradeoff between true positives and false positives. The true positive rate is also known as recall. The false positive rate is one minus specificity. Area under the ROC curve or AUC summarizes model performance. Higher AUC indicates better classification ability of the model. ROC analysis provides techniques to select optimal models and discard suboptimal ones independently of class distribution or error costs.
Ensemble learning refers to combining multiple machine learning models together to improve overall predictive performance. Popular ensemble techniques include boosting, bagging and stacking. Bagging trains models on different subsets of data in parallel. Boosting trains models sequentially. Stacking trains a meta-model on top of other models. Ensemble methods often reduce variance, bias and improve predictions. They combine outputs of individual models by techniques like majority voting for classification or averaging for regression. Ensembles can also combine models built using different algorithms. Model diversity is key for ensemble performance.
Random search is a hyperparameter optimization technique that selects candidates randomly from a defined search space. For each iteration, a set of hyperparameters is randomly sampled from the parameter distributions. The model is trained and evaluated. This random sampling of configurations is repeated for multiple iterations. The optimal hyperparameters are selected based on the iteration that achieved the best performance on a validation set. Unlike grid search, random search does not test all possible combinations but explores the space efficiently. The search space can be defined broadly allowing for a greater coverage of values.
Bias-variance decomposition provides a detailed breakdown of the contribution of bias and variance to the total expected test error of a model. The expected test error can be expressed as the sum of three sources of error - bias, variance and intrinsic noise in the problem. Bias is error due to oversimplifying assumptions in the model. Variance is sensitivity to changes in the training data. Irreducible error is the intrinsic noise in the problem. Understanding this decomposition provides insights into improving model generalization by reducing bias and variance. Techniques like cross-validation and regularization can help find the right balance.
A learning curve represents the validation error trend for a machine learning model when trained on different sizes of training datasets. It plots the amount of training data vs the validation error. As the training set size increases, the validation error initially decreases, reaches a minimum and then increases. The initial part represents underfitting which reduces by adding data. The upwards trend indicates overfitting and provides an estimate of optimal data size. Learning curves help diagnose common modeling issues like high bias, high variance and give a sense of how much performance can improve with more data.
The curse of dimensionality refers to the exponential increase in volume associated with adding extra dimensions. As the number of features or dimensions grows, the amount of data needed to support the model increases exponentially. Having more dimensions increases sparsity of data making it difficult to find patterns. In high dimensions, the data becomes increasingly sparse leading to a higher risk of overfitting. Feature selection, dimensionality reduction and regularization help in mitigating this problem. The curse of dimensionality impacts algorithms differently based on whether they are distance-based, probabilistic or reconstruction-based.
Stratified sampling is a technique used to ensure that the train-test split represents the relative class frequencies in the original dataset. Samples are divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata, and samples are randomly selected proportionally from the stratum. It aims to produce a sample that has approximately the same class proportions as the original set. This helps avoid sampling bias and overrepresentation of a particular class in the subsets. Stratification is commonly used in machine learning before cross-validation or train-test splits to improve model evaluation.
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data transformations to improve model performance. It involves generating new predictive features by combining existing features, applying mathematical transformations, aggregating values etc. Feature engineering leverages understanding of the data and domain to extract meaningful representations before feeding into machine learning algorithms. It is crucial for challenging problems where good features are key to model performance. Methods include binning, scaling, normalization, polynomial features, aggregations and dimensionality reduction techniques.
Overfitting refers to a model that models the training data too well, capturing noise and details, that it negatively impacts its ability to generalize to new data. It occurs when a model fits the training data too closely. An overfit model has low bias but very high variance. It has memorized the noise and details in the training set to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new data. This leads to poor predictions on unseen data though it may have high performance on training data. Overfitting can be mitigated by techniques like regularization, early stopping, and dropout.
Principal component analysis or PCA is a statistical technique to convert possibly correlated variables into linearly uncorrelated variables using an orthogonal transformation. It projects the data onto a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance of the data lies along the first coordinate called the first principal component. Successive coordinates capture decreasing variance. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used for visualization, noise filtering, feature extraction and improving model performance by reducing overfitting. PCA is an unsupervised method that finds hidden structure in data and captures the directions of maximum variance.
Data leakage refers to the unintentional leakage of information about the target variable into the training data which can lead to model overfitting. It causes the model to make overly optimistic predictions on new data because some info was leaked into the training data. Data leakage commonly occurs due to flaws in data collection, annotation, splits or transformations. Detecting and avoiding data leakage is crucial for machine learning to avoid creating invalid models that fail in production. Common cases include unintended peeking at the test labels, train-test contamination, and leakage via derived attributes.
Multicollinearity refers to the occurrence of high correlations among predictor variables in a regression model. It results in inflated variances of the coefficient estimates and makes the estimates unstable and difficult to interpret. Strong multicollinearity can negatively impact model performance. It can be detected using correlation analysis, variance inflation factors and eigenvectors. Remedial measures include removing redundant features, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and ridge regression. Ridge regression penalizes coefficient magnitude which ameliorates impact of multicollinearity.
AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm that combines multiple weak learners into a strong learner in an iterative manner. It focuses on training data that was previously misclassified by weak learners. AdaBoost assigns weights to each training instance. The weights are adjusted adaptively in each round based on the error of the weak learner. Examples that are misclassified gain higher weightage. A new weak learner is added that focuses on the misclassified examples. Predictions from all weak learners are combined through a weighted majority vote to produce the final prediction. AdaBoost reduces bias and variance to improve model performance.
XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting. It is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. XGBoost builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods. It introduces regularization hyperparameters to reduce overfitting which is a challenge for other gradient boosting algorithms. It splits the data into subsets and makes optimal split predictions in parallel using all CPU cores. XGBoost provides hyperparameters for tuning and optimization like subsampling, tree complexity, learning rate. The major advantages of XGBoost are faster training speed, higher efficiency, in-built regularization, parallel processing, cache optimization, handling sparse data and missing values.
Feature scaling refers to the rescaling of features to a common scale, often prior to model training. It is performed to handle features with varying scales and ranges. Scaling brings all features to the same level of magnitude. Common scaling methods are min-max scaling to [0,1] range and standardization to unit variance and zero mean. Feature scaling prevents certain features from dominating others due to their greater magnitude. It speeds up computation and optimization of models like gradient descent. Scaling transforms data without distorting differences in the ranges of features.
Mean normalization scales features by subtracting the mean and scaling to the range zero and one. Mean normalization centers data at zero mean and scales the variability to a fixed range. Centering at mean aids in gradient-based optimization. Normalization to unit range handles varied distributions. Mean normalization is useful preprocessing technique for many machine learning algorithms.
Standardization scales the features to have zero mean and unit variance. Standardization ensures standard normal distribution with no effect of mean and variance differences. Most machine learning techniques assume a normal distribution for features. Standardization helps algorithms that weight inputs like linear regression and distance-based models like KNN. It ensures all features are weighted equally.
One-hot encoding transforms categorical variables with N possible values into N binary variables with one value hot or one. Each binary variable indicates presence or absence of category value. One-hot encoding expands categorical variables into indicator variables equal to one or zero to represent each category. It allows representation of categorical data into a format that algorithms can interpret easily. One-hot encoding avoids assumptions of ordinal relationships in categories. It enables using categorical data in mathematical operations by transforming into numeric representations.
Sigmoid squashes real-valued inputs to outputs between zero and one. Used for binary classification.
Tanh squashes real-valued inputs to outputs between minus zero and one
Softmax converts outputs to probability distribution over predicted classes. For multiclass classification.
A neural network is a interconnected group of nodes, inspired by the human brain, that uses computational modeling for machine learning. Neural networks consist of layers including an input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to other nodes with varying connection strengths or weights. Data enters the input layer, passes through the hidden layers transforming the input, and arrives at the output layer resulting in a prediction. The network is trained by examining training data, generating predictions, and updating weights and biases to optimize the learning objective. Neural networks can identify complex nonlinear relationships between input and output for tasks like classification, recognition, and prediction.
Deep neural networks (DNNs) refer to artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. While ordinary neural networks may have just 2-3 hidden layers, deep neural networks have tens or hundreds of hidden layers. Having more layers enables learning higher level abstractions and complex patterns in data. Deep networks can model complex nonlinear relationships by transforming data across multiple processing layers. Training deep networks requires large training datasets and significant compute power. DNNs have led to breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and other AI applications.
A feedforward neural network is an artificial neural network in which the connections between nodes do not form cycles. It propagates data linearly from input to output layers without loops, processing information in one direction. There are no feedback or recursive connections. Each node receives inputs, performs computation, and produces outputs that are distributed to other neurons. Common feedforward network architectures include multilayer perceptrons usually trained with backpropagation, and radial basis function networks trained via regression techniques. Feedforward NNs learn to map input data to target outputs and excel in pattern recognition and function approximation.
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward artificial neural network composed of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, with each layer connected to the next. Each node uses a nonlinear activation function. An MLP can distinguish data that is not linearly separable by transforming the data from the input space to a higher dimensional space using the hidden layers. This allows MLPs to solve complex classification and regression problems that linear perceptrons cannot. MLPs trained with backpropagation perform well on problems that require modeling complex relationships between inputs and outputs.
The learning rate is a key hyperparameter that controls how quickly a neural network model is adapted to the problem during the training process. It determines the step size of the weight updates after each iteration. The learning rate controls how rapidly the model trains and converges to the optimal solution. Setting the learning too small leads to very slow training. Setting it too large can cause the model to oscillate and become unstable. The learning rate is gradually decreased over the course of training to allow precise search near the optimal parameters. Adaptive learning rate methods like AdaGrad and Adam also dynamically adapt the learning rate during training for faster convergence.
Activation functions in neural networks introduce non-linear properties into the network. They determine the output of a node or layer in the network based on its input. Some common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU and softmax. Activation functions allow neural networks to learn complex relationships between features and outputs, perform nonlinear classification or regression, and model complex feature interactions. Choice of activations affects model convergence, training speed and performance. Sigmoid squashes inputs to 0-1 range but suffers from vanishing gradients. ReLU overcomes this by thresholding at zero but may have dying neuron problem. Optimizer choice should match activation characteristics.
Transfer learning involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained neural network to a new task. It initializes the new model with pretrained weights and biases from base network like VGG, ResNet trained on large datasets. Fine-tuning then adapts the pretrained model to new task by updating the weights through continued training at much lower learning rates on new dataset. Transfer learning is used when limited data is available for a task. It provides faster convergence and higher performance by initiating with general features learned previously.
Data augmentation artificially expands size of training dataset by applying transformations such as flipping, rotating, skewing, translating, scaling, adding noise etc to generate variations of images. It improves model generalization by exposing it to a wider variety of training data. Image augmentation effectively generates additional data from existing images to minimize overfitting in computer vision models and enhance performance particularly when training data is limited.
Recurrent neural networks are a type of artificial neural network well-suited for processing sequential data such as text, time series data and speech. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have cyclic connections that provide context or memory from previous inputs to influence the current output. This enables modeling temporal dynamic behavior. The cycle allows information to persist preserving information across time steps. RNNs can process input sequences of varying length. LSTM and GRUs are enhanced RNN architectures to capture long-term dependencies.
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units are a building unit for Recurrent Neural Networks designed to model longer term dependencies and reduce vanishing gradients. LSTMs have a chain-like structure but also have a memory cell with a self-connected recurrent edge to preserve information across long sequences. It also has input, output and forget gates to regulate information flow into and out of the cell. This architecture equips LSTM with longer memory and ability to model longer sequences.
Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are another variant of Recurrent Neural Networks used in sequence modeling. They adaptively capture dependencies over different time scales using reset and update gates. The reset gate determines how much past info to forget. The update gate controls how much past info to keep. GRUs have simpler structure than LSTM, lacking an output gate, but exhibit similar performance. They require fewer parameters and are generally faster to train than LSTMs.
Sequence modeling refers to predictive modeling of data where the inputs and/or outputs have a sequential relationship. Recurrent neural networks like LSTMs and GRUs excel at sequence modeling tasks where the temporal order matters like speech, text, time series, etc. Sequence models preserve information about the order and dependencies between data points in a sequence. They are able to model variable length sequences and long-term dependencies between elements.
Natural language processing (NLP) focuses on interactions between computers and human language. NLP techniques enable understanding and generation of human language content. Key capabilities include speech recognition, machine translation, question answering and text summarization. NLP models like transformer networks have achieved state-of-the-art results by modeling language as sequences. Pretrained NLP models can be fine-tuned on language tasks.
Dropout is a regularization technique for neural networks that randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training. Dropout prevents overfitting and improves generalization by introducing noise and redundancy. Each training iteration samples a different architecture by dropping different units. This prevents complex co-adaptations making the model robust to missing inputs. Dropout approximately combines many different network architectures efficiently. The fraction of units dropped is a key hyperparameter. During prediction, the entire network is evaluated without dropout.
Few-shot learning aims to learn effective classifiers from very few labeled examples per category. Whereas most machine learning techniques require large amounts of data, few-shot learning can learn from just one or a few examples of each new class. It leverages knowledge transfer from previously learned classes and representations. Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, techniques train models that can quickly adapt to new classes given only a few examples via fine-tuning or metric learning approaches.
Class imbalance refers to classification problems where the number of samples across classes is not equal. One class heavily outnumbers other classes. This skewed distribution between classes makes it challenging for standard algorithms to learn the underrepresented classes as effectively. Solutions involve resampling data to equalize class distribution, penalizing models on misclassifying underrepresented classes, synthesizing new minority class data, and algorithm modifications to factor class distribution.
Streamlit is an open-source Python library for creating web apps and dashboards for machine learning and data science projects.

Key features include tensor computing, deep neural networks, libraries like torchvision and torchtext, distributed training capabilities, and Python first design. It competes with TensorFlow and is widely used in research and production environments.
Model development refers to the process of building, training, and optimizing a machine learning model to make accurate predictions on new data. It involves dataset preparation, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and iterative training and evaluation of models on test data. Rigorous model development aims to create highly performant models that generalize well to new data based on the metrics defined for the problem.
Model deployment is the process of making a trained machine learning model available in production systems to generate predictions on real-world data. It involves exporting the model architecture and weights, writing prediction code, integrating the model into applications, scaling to handle large data volumes, monitoring predictions, and updating models periodically. Deployment requires optimizing the model for prediction speed and servicing requests at scale. Testing is done to ensure the model performs as expected when deployed.
Data versioning refers to the practice of tracking changes to training data over time within machine learning systems. As training data gets updated, models need to be retrained and tested on the new versions of data. Data versioning assigns unique identifiers to specific versions or instances of datasets. It helps maintain reproducibility and provenance of model development as data changes. Versioning enables managing separate training and test datasets properly. It also helps when rolling back models if updated data causes performance declines.
MLOps or Machine Learning Operations refers to the practice of collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage production ML systems. The goals of MLOps are to increase efficiency of taking models to production, improve model performance via continuous delivery, and enhance reliability and uptime of ML systems. MLOps introduces DevOps best practices like CI/CD, logging, monitoring, automation to machine learning. Key MLOps process include: Automating the machine learning lifecycle, Infrastructure management and configuration, Model packaging, Deployment and serving, Monitoring models in production, Re-training and updating models continually, Scaling model training and deployment for large datasets, Maintaining reproducibility and provenance of ML systems.

C++ is a compiled, statically-typed, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ extends C and provides facilities for low-level memory manipulation along with high-level abstractions like classes, inheritance, templates, exceptions etc. C++ gives programmers control over hardware while providing language constructs for higher level abstraction. C++ provides performance and access to low-level functionality which makes it suitable for performance-critical applications.
Java is a compiled, statically-typed, object-oriented programming language. Java code is compiled into bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This architecture provides portability across platforms. Java syntax is similar to C/C++ but is strictly object-oriented with no global functions or variables. Java has automatic memory management using garbage collection. Java is used for software development ranging from backend services, web and mobile applications, big data frameworks to scientific computing.
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive. JavaScript code is embedded in HTML pages and runs in the browser. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a core technology used in web development. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm language supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. JavaScript engines in modern browsers execute the code very efficiently. JavaScript is also used in game development, mobile apps and server-side programming.
Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and categorizing important entities (names, organizations, locations) within unstructured text into predefined categories such as person, location, organization, date, time, percentages, monetary values. It is a core component of many NLP applications like question answering, summarization, sentiment analysis among others. NER serves as a first step towards information extraction by annotating atomic elements in text and distinguishing between classes of named entities. Advanced NER systems use conditional random fields, recurrent neural networks like LSTMs with word embeddings to sequentially label entities. Evaluation metrics include precision, recall and F1-score.
Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing and text analysis techniques to identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information from text data. The goal is to determine the attitude, opinions, emotions expressed in text - whether the writer's feelings towards a particular topic or overall contextual polarity of a document is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis has applications in understanding customer experiences, product feedback, brand monitoring, and public health. Lexicon-based methods use sentiment dictionaries while machine learning techniques like neural networks identify patterns from annotated examples for polarity classification.
Language modeling refers to developing statistical models to predict the next word or character in a sequence given the previous words or context. Language models assign probability distributions over sequences of words or characters in order to capture characteristics of a language.

Modern language translation leverages deep learning models like recurrent neural networks, convolutional networks and transformer architectures. Neural machine translation works by encoding source sentence into a fixed-length vector and decoding into the target language. Evaluation metrics for language translation include BLEU, METEOR and ROUGE which compare machine output to human references.
Word2vec refers to a group of shallow two-layer neural networks used to create dense word embeddings. Word2vec models like CBOW and skip-gram learn to predict a target word from source context words in a sliding window. The weights of the hidden layer form the word vectors capturing semantic relationships between words. Word2vec allows vector arithmetic operations between words. Pre-trained Word2vec models are used to initialize deep learning NLP models.
GloVe (Global Vectors) is an unsupervised learning technique to generate word embeddings by aggregating global word-word co-occurrence statistics. GloVe creates vectors based on the ratio of word co-occurrence probabilities rather than using local context windows.

Transformers can model long-range dependencies in sequences more efficiently compared to RNNs. The transformer network handles variable length sequences using constant length representations. Transformers have become the dominant sequence modeling approach across NLP, outperforming RNN models.
Attention is a technique used in sequence modeling that focuses the model on relevant parts of the input sequence while generating the output sequence. Attention scores are computed at each step to determine which encoder hidden states to pay attention to. The context vector is computed as the weighted average of encoder states based on attention distribution. Attention provides interpretability into model predictions.
Beam search is an iterative search algorithm used to find the top k most likely output sequences in sequence models like machine translation, speech recognition etc. During decoding, it considers all possible expansions up to length L and retains only the k most probable candidates, where k is the beam width. This prunes the search space to make inference tractable. Beam search finds reasonably good solutions efficiently while balancing optimality and speed. Larger beam widths improve results at the cost of computation time.
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text translated from one natural language into another. BLEU compares the candidate machine translated text with human reference translations using a modified form of precision. It measures how many words overlap between machine and human translations using n-gram overlap scores. BLEU penalizes translations that are shorter than references. It has become the standard evaluation metric for machine translation systems.
ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used to evaluate automatic text summarization and machine translation systems. ROUGE measures summary quality by comparing it to ideal hand-written summaries using n-gram statistics. Different ROUGE metrics calculate matches based on word sequences and word pairs between the candidate and reference summaries. High ROUGE scores indicate better summarization performance.
Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) is a Word2vec model architecture used to learn word embeddings. In CBOW, the model predicts the target word using the surrounding context words as input to the network. Multiple context words are combined to predict the center word. The weights between the input and hidden layer form the word embeddings that encode semantic relationships. CBOW smoothens over a lot of the syntactic properties of language in learning embeddings.
Skip-gram is another Word2vec model architecture that predicts the surrounding context words given a target word as input. In contrast with CBOW, skip-gram uses a target word to predict its context. This forces the model to learn detailed syntactic patterns of words and perform well on small datasets. Skip-gram based word vectors tend to represent rare words better than CBOW models.

Lemmatization is the process of determining the lemma or base form of a word by removing inflectional endings and mapping the word to its canonical form. For example, 'saw', 'seeing', 'seen' are mapped to the base form 'see'. Lemmatization relies on detailed dictionaries containing part-of-speech and morphological analysis to transform words to their root form. It produces the morphological root word which serves as the normalized representation of all its inflected variants.
Stemming is the process of removing affixes from words to arrive at a common base form or stem. It uses heuristic techniques and crude chopping rules to prune words to their stems. Stemming often simply chops off endings instead of linguistically analyzing internal structures. For example, 'argue', 'argued', 'argues' are all stemmed to 'argu'. Stemmers are faster but more aggressive compared to lemmatizers. Overstemming can occur where variants of a word get conflated undesirably.
Tokenization is the task of demarcating and possibly classifying sections of a string of input characters into meaningful semantic units such as words, punctuation, numbers and other elements called tokens.

BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) is a denoising autoencoder modeled after the standard Transformer-based machine translation architecture. It is pre-trained by corrupting text with arbitrary noising functions and learning a model to reconstruct the original text. BART uses a standard Transformer-based neural machine translation architecture with a bidirectional encoder and an autoregressive decoder. The encoder maps an input sequence of token embeddings to a sequence of continuous representations. The decoder then generates an output sequence of tokens one element at a time based on the encoder output. For pretraining, text sequences are noised using operations like token masking, token deletion, sentence permutation, and text infilling to create a corrupted sequence. The model is trained to reconstruct the original text sequence from the corrupted version. This denoising autoencoder approach allows BART to learn textual representations that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream NLP tasks.

n-grams are contiguous sequences of n items from a sequence of text or speech. For natural language processing, n-grams are typically sequences of consecutive linguistic units such as letters, phonemes, syllables or words. n-grams are used for statistical language modeling and feature extraction for tasks like text classification. Typically n-grams are obtained by sliding a window of size n over the text data. n-grams capture local sequential information and allow models to make predictions based on partial context. The optimal size of n depends on the task, with small values like 1-3 being common. 
Stopwords are words filtered out before or after linguistic processing of natural language data like text. These are common words that generally do not contribute to meaning such as articles, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns and other function words. Stopword removal or filtering is done to focus analysis on the significant words instead.
Text augmentation refers to artificially generating additional training examples from original text data to expand the size and diversity of datasets used for developing natural language processing models. Simple augmentation techniques include word substitution, deletion, swapping, and insertion based on linguistic properties of the text. For example, synonyms from WordNet can be swapped in while maintaining sentence meaning. More advanced methods can paraphrase or backtranslate full sentences. Noise can also be added through misspellings, abbreviations, stemming variations and more. Text augmentation is done to reduce overfitting of models to the training distribution and improve generalization. Augmentation also helps models learn invariant and robust representations. The increase in training data reduces needs for manually labeled examples. Domain-specific augmentation that maintains meanings is helpful for many applications. Augmentation is crucial when training data is limited, though overuse can insert artifacts. A balance is required to generate useful new examples without excessive distortions. The augmentation approach should suit the model and end task.
Finetuning is a technique for adapting a pretrained machine learning model to a downstream task by updating some subset of the model's parameters using labeled data from the downstream task. It builds on the concept of transfer learning, where information extracted by the pretrained model on its original training objective can boost performance on related tasks with limited data. Finetuning selectively updates the higher-level parts of the network through continued training on the new data, while keeping lower-level features fixed. This adjusts the model to the new task while avoiding overfitting and preserving relevant features from the original pretraining. Determining what layers to update and optimal hyperparameters depends on factors like model architecture and dataset size. Contrastive finetuning alternates between the original pretraining task and downstream task. Finetuning transforms powerful generic models into specialized ones for target tasks like classification and question answering in NLP.
Multilingual natural language processing models are designed to support more than one language within a single model architecture. They are pretrained on text corpora containing data for multiple languages, allowing them to encode linguistic properties in a shared representation space. The universal parameters in these models can then be efficiently fine-tuned for downstream tasks across different languages. This provides scalability and consistency over training specialized monolingual models. Multilingual models rely on shared subword vocabulary spanning many languages to handle input tokens. Additional tricks like language ID tags, balanced corpora sampling, and full attention enable learning joint representations. For example, mBERT from Google is a multilingual BERT model trained on over 100 languages. The goal of these models is to leverage similarities and differences across languages to learn both language-specific and cross-lingual features useful for transfer learning. Multilingual models are especially useful for low-resource languages.
Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim is to encode the input into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct the output from this representation. An autoencoder consists of an encoder function that maps the input to a hidden code, and a decoder that maps the code to a reconstruction of the original input. The network is trained to minimize the difference between the input and output, which forces the hidden code to capture the most useful properties of the data. This code can then serve as a compressed representation for tasks like dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and generative modeling. Autoencoders can have multiple layers forming deep architectures and leverage techniques like convolutions for image data. Sparsity constraints and regularization can improve codings. Variants like variational, convolutional, and denoising autoencoders exist, with different loss formulations and training procedures.
ResNet (Residual Neural Network) is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for image classification and recognition tasks. It introduced the concept of residual blocks where the input to a layer is added to the output using a skip connection, allowing information to skip over layers. This helps combat the vanishing gradient problem when training very deep networks. The core insight is that stacking layers should not degrade the network's representational power, but only add residuals to improve modeling. ResNets enable construction of networks with hundreds or thousands of layers that can be efficiently trained. Various improvements have been made over time, including bottleneck blocks and dilated convolutions for dense feature extraction. ResNet remains a foundational network architecture for computer vision.
VGG models use only 3x3 convolutions and progressively downsampling via maxpooling, with consecutive convolutional layers doubled after each max pooling step. VGG16 contains 16 weight layers and VGG19 contains 19. All hidden layers use ReLU activation. VGG models apply transfer learning effectively by using features from latter convolutional layers in new tasks. Their structured simplicity and transparency aid interpretability. However, they have large computational requirements due to the linear stacking of high-dimensional convolutions. Later networks addressed this via techniques like bottlenecks and residuals. Still, VGG convincingly showed the efficacy of simple stacked convnets through its strong ImageNet performance with thorough evaluation.

EfficientNets achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet with an order of magnitude better efficiency than prior models. The compound scaling method allows easy scaling up or down to obtain models with different desired resource efficiencies. The scaled networks retain model expressiveness through depth, width, and resolution together rather than isolated dimensions. Automated neural architecture search helps find optimal scaling coefficients. The result is a flexible family of models offering an accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. EfficientNet models require significantly fewer parameters and computations than traditional convolutional networks while improving accuracy.

The RPN proposes ROI pools which are fed into the Fast R-CNN detector. The RPN and Fast R-CNN detector are merged into a single unified network by sharing convolutional features. Loss functions for both components are jointly trained end-to-end. The RPN significantly accelerates region proposal generation while improving detection accuracy over Fast R-CNN. Faster R-CNN enables practical and accurate real-world object detection systems by improving region proposal and integrating it efficiently into the detection pipeline.
UNet is a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks. UNet architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path enabling precise localization. The contracting path follows a typical CNN, gradually reducing resolution through pooling. The expansive path upsamples features back to original resolution using transposed convolutions. Skip connections transfer features from contracting path to expanding path to retain fine-grained information. This enables precise segmentation with use of both local and global context. The U shape connects the contracting and expanding paths. UNet does not contain fully connected layers and only uses convolutional layers with ReLUs and padding to preserve spatial dimensions. UNet was originally devised for segmentation in microscopy images. It trains end-to-end from few images and yields more precise segmentations than sliding window methods. UNet remains a popular choice for segmentation tasks in medical imaging and computer vision.
VNet is a volumetric convolutional neural network designed to process volumetric medical images and predict 3D segmentations. It operates directly on voxel data rather than slice-by-slice 2D networks. The core is a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. The convolutional encoder stage uses residual blocks with multiple 3D convolution layers capturing representations of the 3D volume. The decoder upsamples these representations back to full input resolution using transposed convolutions. Skip connections retain fine-grained information from encoder to decoder. At each resolution level, encoder features are concatenated to decoder features. A final convolution layer predicts voxel-wise segmentation. Additional components like deep supervision and dice loss aid training. VNet demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on lung nodule segmentation in CT scans. It was one of the early volumetric networks able to effectively process 3D medical scans while previous approaches relied on extracting 2D slices.

Positional encodings enable the self-attention layers to incorporate sequential order and distance relationships. Various positional encoding formulations exist, with tradeoffs between flexibility and efficiency. Positional information is key for transformers to effectively model sequences. Dynamic position representations like axial positional encodings have also been proposed. The choice of positional encoding affects what long-range dependencies the transformer can capture.
Multi-head self-attention is an attention mechanism used in transformers where attention is computed multiple times in parallel across different representation subspaces. Multiple individual attention heads are linearly projected into lower-dimensional subspaces, yielding different representation subspaces known as heads. Self-attention is applied to each head, and the results are concatenated and projected again. Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This provides richer modeling capabilities over single-head attention, allowing the model to capture different context factors. The transformer's encoding layers use multi-head self-attention to enable modeling of dependencies from different representation subspaces. Multi-head attention provides transformers with an efficient and powerful mechanism for leveraging different context factors.

Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are likelihood-based generative models that can generate high-quality samples such as images. DDPMs train a parametric denoising model to remove injected noise from data based on a stochastic forward diffusion process and reverse diffusion sampling procedure. The forward process gradually adds Gaussian noise over multiple steps, corrupting the data until it becomes an unstructured latent variable. The reverse process starts from noise and denoises it into a sample from the data distribution through multiple predictor steps conditioned on previous noisy versions. Training optimizes the predictors to reverse the diffusion by minimizing the noise removed at each step. DDPMs combine analytical noise generation and parameterized neural network denoisers. This structured framework enables efficiently training deep generative models.
Score matching is a technique to train probabilistic models by directly optimizing the score function - the gradient of the log density. It circumvents density estimation and sampling needed for maximum likelihood training. The denoising score matching objective trains a model to minimize noise by predicting the gradient of the data density at each noisy sample. Score matching estimators based on perturbations like noise injection have asymptotic maximum likelihood guarantees but avoid explicitly modeling the partition function.

Diffusion models simulate reverse-time Langevin dynamics to generate data, using the score function to parametrically predict the reverse drift and diffusion terms. The model is trained to denoise samples along the stochastic dynamics by predicting gradients guiding back to high density regions of the data distribution. Langevin dynamics provide the foundations connecting score matching training objectives with generative sampling procedures.
Gaussian diffusion refers to the injection of Gaussian random noise into data samples over multiple iterations to gradually corrupt them into unstructured noise. Diffusion probabilistic models use Gaussian diffusion processes that add isotropic Gaussian noise typically with a fixed variance schedule over steps.

Stable Diffusion is trained on image-text pairs from datasets like LAION-400M using a simplified form of latent diffusion. The unprecedented scale enables high-quality conditional image generation from text. Code and models have been open-sourced, allowing wide application and extension.
Diffusion distillation trains a small distilled student model to replicate the outputs of a larger teacher diffusion model using distillation techniques. The student learns to sample from the same distribution as the teacher by minimizing the KL divergence between student and teacher sample distributions. This distills the complex generative distribution into a compact model by optimizing the sampling process rather than just mimicking logits. Diffusion distillation can compress very large models like DALL-E into highly efficient versions for practical deployment, making text-to-image generation much more accessible. More broadly, it provides a methodology to compress generative diffusion models.
